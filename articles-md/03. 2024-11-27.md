## Introduction

Sustainable finance has become essential in modern investment strategies, emphasizing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors critical for fostering resilient economies and societies. Aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it calls for a broad commitment from public and private sectors to integrate financial  strategies  that  tackle  global  challenges  such  as  climate  change  and  resource  degradation.  The  European Commission highlights that sustainable finance extends beyond basic ESG criteria, embedding these principles within frameworks aimed at achieving long-term economic and ecological stability. (Kumar et al., 2021)

Open-source  technology  serves  as  a  crucial  enabler  in  this  context,  enhancing  transparency,  inclusivity,  and adaptability in sustainable finance. By providing accessible frameworks, open-source platforms empower financial institutions and policymakers to collaborate on tailored solutions while reducing traditional barriers to entry. This adaptability facilitates real-time data sharing  and  informed  risk  analysis  essential  for  addressing  evolving sustainability challenges. (Ozili, 2022)

Furthermore, open-source platforms integrate emerging technologies with sustainable finance, allowing for innovative tools to meet sustainability objectives. Machine learning models enhance the capacity to analyze climate-related risks, while  blockchain  technology  ensures  rigorous  tracking  of  sustainability  metrics,  mitigating  greenwashing  risks. Internet of Things (IoT) devices continuously feed data into open-source repositories, enabling precise monitoring of

emissions and resource efficiency across supply chains. (Hasan et al., 2024)

The article also examines sustainable fintech initiatives that utilize open-source frameworks to support climate-aligned investments and emissions tracking. For instance, the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) helps institutions evaluate portfolio alignment with climate goals. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Temperature Alignment Tool assists in aligning investments with a 1.5°C pathway. (IPCC, 2018) Other tools, such as the Cloud Carbon Footprint and the AWS Sustainability Insights Framework, provide insights for emissions optimization and automated monitoring across supply chains. Additionally, the Blockchain Carbon Accounting Tool ensures secure tracking of carbon data, supporting compliance with ESG standards.

Together,  these  initiatives  contribute  to  sustainable  finance's  mission  of  integrating  climate  accountability  and resilience into investment practices, fostering alignment with global climate goals and promoting a net-zero economy.

## Climate finance projects

The Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA), an open-source tool originally developed by the 2° Investing Initiative (2DII) and now under the stewardship of the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), is a sophisticated software application designed to assess the alignment of financial portfolios with climate goals. Through scenario analysis, PACTA examines whether investments across climate-critical sectors-such as power, coal mining, oil and gas,  automotive  manufacturing,  cement,  steel,  and  aviation-are  consistent  with  pathways  that  limit  global temperature increases, making it invaluable for institutions aiming to manage their climate-related risks proactively. (PACTA, 2024)

PACTA's methodology is notably forward-looking: it assesses a portfolio's alignment based on future projections rather than historical emissions, leveraging five-year production plans to evaluate the trajectory of sectors accountable for around 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions. (PACTA, 2024) This anticipatory approach aligns with the Paris Agreement's  foundational  principles,  which  emphasize  voluntary,  country-specific  commitments  rather  than universal, binding targets. As Falkner (2016) discusses, the Paris Agreement reflects a shift from the top-down rigidity of prior climate treaties to a more flexible model, allowing countries to set individualized goals that reflect their unique economic and environmental contexts. (Falkner, 2016) This flexibility is mirrored in PACTA's adaptable framework, which enables financial institutions to tailor their portfolio assessments to various climate scenarios, thus promoting climate  resilience  and  the  potential  to  avoid  'stranded  assets'  in  carbon-intensive  sectors  as  regulations  tighten. (PACTA, 2024)

RMI's current stewardship of PACTA reflects a commitment to expand its scalability and user accessibility, focusing on integration within routine investment decision-making and regulatory compliance across global markets. RMI's objectives underscore PACTA's open-source nature, which facilitates widespread adoption and collective input in climate-risk assessment, ultimately aligning the financial sector with the adaptive, cooperative framework advocated by the Paris Agreement. (PACTA, 2024) (Falkner, 2016)

The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Finance Tool offers an open-source platform designed to guide financial institutions in setting and tracking climate-aligned targets for their portfolios. Created to align financial activities with the 1.5°C warming goal established by the Paris Agreement, this tool translates the climate ambitions of individual investments into actionable metrics, allowing users to gauge alignment with science-based targets.

## Biodiversity and circular economy initiatives

In sustainable finance, robust methodologies are critical for enabling reliable carbon accounting and fostering investor confidence,  particularly  within  frameworks  like  REDD+  (Reducing  Emissions  from  Deforestation  and  Forest Degradation). The Jurisdictional and Nested REDD+ (JNR) Methodology developed by Verra plays a pivotal role by establishing  a  transparent,  standardized  approach  for  integrating  local  forest  conservation  projects  within  broader jurisdictional  REDD+  frameworks.  Through  "nesting,"  the  JNR  framework  allows  local  projects  to  contribute meaningfully to national or regional climate targets, creating a multi-layered system that can scale effectively across governance levels. (Irawan et al., 2019)

The methodology's reliance on rigorous Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) processes, paired with strong social and environmental safeguards, enhances its credibility within carbon markets. As noted by Del Valle et al. (2013), a sustained REDD+ financing mechanism requires stable and transparent safeguards to maintain its viability as  an  asset  class,  emphasizing  that  success  depends  on  the  integration  of  MRV  with  social  commitments.  Key deliverables in the JNR framework include transparent governance structures, the conservation of ecosystem services, and active participation from indigenous and local communities. These elements are essential to creating a credible carbon market that values not only emissions reductions but also social and environmental integrity. (Irawan et al.,

## 2019)(UNFCCC, 2024)

In facilitating public and private investments in REDD+, JNR is designed to align early action initiatives with longterm climate goals, addressing both voluntary market needs and compliance-based mechanisms. This alignment is critical  as  it  provides  a  consistent  pathway  for  carbon  credits  generated  at  local  levels  to  be  included  in  national registries,  reinforcing  the  accountability  and  scalability  of  climate  finance  frameworks.  As  sustainable  finance continues  to  grow,  methodologies  like  JNR  offer  a  proving  ground  for  the  integration  of  high-integrity  carbon accounting  practices,  supporting  global  climate  objectives  through  transparent  and  multi-layered  collaboration. (Rainforest Foundation, 2024)

The RiskMapJNR tool is a Python-based open-source package developed to support deforestation risk mapping within the  Jurisdictional  and  Nested  REDD+  (JNR)  framework.  Designed  to  assist  in  the  analysis  and  visualization  of deforestation risks, this tool aligns with the JNR methodology by enabling the creation of spatial risk maps that can be used to inform conservation and policy decisions at both local and jurisdictional scales. Leveraging historical forest cover data, RiskMapJNR applies geospatial analysis to evaluate and visualize deforestation trends over time, helping to identify high-risk areas and prioritize intervention efforts effectively.

RiskMapJNR operates by processing raster data on forest cover changes and utilizing a series of steps-such as calculating  distances  to  forest  edges,  assessing  local  deforestation  rates,  and  categorizing  risk  based  on  various analytical models. These steps culminate in a structured output that represents deforestation risk across specific areas, allowing users to adjust parameters, like window size and slicing method, to achieve optimized results for their regions of interest. The generated maps, which can be configured for different spatial resolutions, categorize areas by their deforestation risk levels, providing essential insights for resource allocation and environmental strategy development.

## Open data resources

The global challenge of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions remains central to sustainable finance and climate policy, where the intricate demands of equitable emissions reduction are pivotal to meeting international climate targets. GHGs, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, contribute to atmospheric warming by trapping heat, a process  that  accelerates  climate  change  effects  like  rising  sea  levels,  extreme  weather,  and  biodiversity  loss. Addressing these emissions necessitates a nuanced approach that balances the historic emissions responsibilities of developed nations with the developmental priorities of lower-emitting countries. This balance invokes the principles of  climate  justice  and  equitable  burden-sharing,  which,  as  Azar  and  Johansson  (2024)  highlight,  must  underpin emissions  reduction  frameworks  to  ensure  that  they  account  for  each  nation's  historical  contributions,  economic capacity, and current per capita emissions. (Azar &amp; Johansson, 2024)

Climate  justice  advocates  for  GHG  allocations  that  reflect  these  inequalities,  suggesting  that  higher-emission, wealthier  nations  take  on  a  larger  share  of  emissions  reduction  efforts.  However,  the  creation  of  these  equitable frameworks  requires  precise,  accessible  models  capable  of  simulating  climate  impacts  under  varying  emissions scenarios, making transparent tools for temperature response modeling essential. (Azar &amp; Johansson, 2024)

The Finite Amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model offers an accessible and efficient solution to these needs. As an open-source, computationally streamlined climate model, FaIR simulates global temperature responses based on GHG emissions scenarios, using impulse response functions to model the dynamics between radiative forcing and temperature. This capacity makes FaIR highly valuable for policymakers and researchers, enabling them to examine the effects of emissions pathways on global temperatures and to model the temperature implications of different policy approaches. (GitHub, 2024)(Geoffroy et al., 2013)

To enhance the model's accuracy in simulating temperature changes, FaIR employs the Transient Climate Response (TCR) methodology from Geoffroy et al. (2013), which accounts for deep-ocean heat uptake and provides insights into the stability of temperature trajectories over time-a key factor for evaluating long-term emissions reduction strategies. FaIR also includes aerosol forcing calculations from Stevens (2015), which address variability in climate responses  due  to  aerosols,  a  critical  element  for  accurate  near-term  climate  forecasting.  (Geoffroy  et  al.,

2013)(Stevens, 2015)

FaIR's user-friendly interface and modular design make it possible for users to experiment with custom emissions pathways and observe projected impacts on global temperatures in real-time, supporting informed decision-making in climate  policy  and  finance.  Its  comprehensive  documentation  further  supports  diverse  climate  modeling  needs, offering users detailed guidance on configuration and parameterization, accessible via FaIR's documentation page. These attributes render FaIR an invaluable tool for policymakers and stakeholders dedicated to modeling fair and sustainable emissions scenarios in alignment with principles of climate justice. (FAIR Model, 2024)
