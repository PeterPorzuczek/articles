### Abstract
This article is an overview of actively developed open code solutions in the field of Sustainable Technology. There are many open source solutions in the field of Sustainable Technology. The review covers selected solutions from the categories of Renewable Energy, Energy Storage, Energy Demand and Efficiency, Energy Systems, Emissions, Ecological Footprint, Biosphere, Natural Resources, and Business Development. Open source is a type of computer software in which the source code is made available under a license whereby the copyright owner grants users the rights to examine, change, and distribute the software under a free software license. There are many business models for open source software developers. In addition to free sharing, it can be sold and used commercially. By using the open source model, solutions can be improved day by day and volunteers help in the work, which makes the development of such projects faster, which can increase reliability and bring many additional benefits. It is important to keep an eye on the developments in the area of open source solutions in Sustainable Technology as they can be helpful for other research projects in this field.
